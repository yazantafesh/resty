# Component Based UI

## Description

- Begin with installing and running the application, making note of it’s architecture

- The App component serves as the container for all sub-components of this application

  - Leave this component as a Class
  - The app imports an .scss file to serve as the base design for the site
  - Header, Footer, Results and Form components are imported from other files using ES6 import syntax

- Each of the components use their own .scss file for styling

- The Form component should:

  - Call back to the App component via function sent down through a prop so that the app can begin the process

- The Results component should show mock API results
